Welcome to the **Du Lab**!

We are a research group exploring the complex interplay between the immune system and disease. Our interests span both basic mechanisms and translational applications in immunology and genomics.

### ðŸ”¬ Research Focus
- Type I interferonâ€“related diseases, including rheumatic autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases  
- Plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) biology and nucleic acid sensing via TLR7/8/9  
- Tumor immunology and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)

### ðŸ§ª Cutting-Edge Techniques
- Functional genomics and CRISPR-based screening  
- Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq  
- Spatial transcriptomics and systems-level analysis  
- Genetic mouse models for in vivo immunology
