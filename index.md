Welcome to the **Du Lab**!

We are a research group exploring the complex interplay between the immune system and disease. Our work bridges fundamental immunology and translational applications in autoimmunity, infection, and cancer.

---

### ðŸ”¬ Research Focus
- Type I interferonâ€“related diseases, including rheumatic autoimmune and infectious diseases  
- Plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) biology and TLR7/8/9-mediated nucleic acid sensing  
- Tumor immunology and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)

---

### ðŸ§ª Core Techniques
- Functional genomics and CRISPR-based screening  
- Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), ATAC-seq  
- Spatial transcriptomics and systems immunology  
- Genetic mouse models for in vivo disease modeling
